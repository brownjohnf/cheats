# Cheats

The markdown files in this repo are named by executable, and contain
(potentially) useful "cheats" for solving encountered problems.

They range from gotchas to things that I can just never remember when
they happen, and I wind up looking up all the time.

## Roadmap

I'm just going to keep tossing things in here as I come across them.

## Contributing

If you have something you'd like to add, pull requests are welcome.
